# Job Portal

Welcome to the **Job Portal** project! This application serves as a comprehensive platform for job seekers and employers, connecting talent with opportunities. The project aims to streamline the job search process by providing an intuitive interface for users to browse job listings, apply for positions, and manage their applications. Employers can post job openings, review applications, and manage their hiring process efficiently.

## Tech Stack

The project is built using a cutting-edge tech stack that ensures a seamless user experience and robust backend support.

### **Frontend:**

- **React.js:** A powerful JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces. React's component-based architecture allows for the creation of reusable UI components, making development more efficient.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level styling capabilities, enabling developers to build custom designs without writing traditional CSS. It offers a consistent and responsive design with minimal effort.
- **Shadcn UI:** A collection of components and utilities for building modern web applications with ease. It complements Tailwind CSS by offering a set of pre-designed components that follow best practices.

### **Backend:**

- **Supabase:** An open-source Firebase alternative that provides a real-time database, authentication, and storage services. It's built on top of PostgreSQL, offering a scalable and flexible solution for managing data and user authentication.
- **Clerk Authentication:** A modern authentication solution that handles user sign-up, sign-in, and profile management. It integrates seamlessly with Supabase, providing a secure and easy-to-use authentication system.

## Implementation Guide

### **Getting Started**

To get started with the Job Portal project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivgit42/Job-Portal.git
cd Job-Portal
```

### **Backend Setup**

1. **Supabase Project:**

   - Create a new project in [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).
   - Set up your database schema and configure the necessary tables for job listings, user profiles, and applications.

2. **Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the project root and configure the following environment variables:

   ```plaintext
   REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   REACT_APP_CLERK_FRONTEND_API=your_clerk_frontend_api
   ```

### **Frontend Setup**

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   Navigate to the project directory and install the required packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Frontend:**
   Start the frontend application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### **Handling Frontend and Backend**

The frontend and backend of this project are tightly integrated, with React handling the UI and Supabase managing the data layer. Clerk Authentication ensures that user data and authentication flows are secure and seamless.

- **Data Handling:** Supabase's real-time database allows for instant updates to job listings and applications. React components use hooks and context to manage state and interact with the backend.
- **Authentication:** Clerk handles all authentication-related tasks, including sign-up, sign-in, and user profile management, ensuring that only authenticated users can interact with the job portal.

## End Story

The **Job Portal** project is a modern solution for job seekers and employers alike. By leveraging the power of React, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, and Clerk Authentication, this project delivers a responsive, scalable, and secure platform that can be expanded and enhanced as needed.

Whether you're a developer looking to understand full-stack development or a user searching for job opportunities, this project offers a solid foundation and a seamless experience. Dive in, explore, and see how this technology stack can bring your ideas to life.
